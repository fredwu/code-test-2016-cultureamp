# Culture Amp's Developer Coding Test

Your task is to build a CLI application to parse and display survey data from CSV files, and display the results.

## Data Format

### Survey Data
Included in the folder example-data are three sample data files defining surveys:
* survey-1.csv
* survey-2.csv
* survey-3.csv

Each row represents a question in that survey with headers defining what question data is in each column.

### Response Data
And three sample files containing responses to the corresponding survey:
* survey-1-responses.csv
* survey-2-responses.csv
* survey-3-responses.csv

Response columns are always in the following order:
* Email
* Employee Id
* Submitted At Timestamp (if there is no submitted at timestamp, you can assume the user did not submit a survey) 
* Each column from the fourth onwards are responses to survey questions.
* Answers to Rating Questions are always an integer between (and including) 1 and 5. 
* Blank answers represent not answered. 
* Answers to Single Select Questions can be any string.

## The Application

Your coding challenge is to build an application that allows the user to specify a survey file and a file for it's results. It should read them in and present a summary of the survey results. A command line application that takes a data file as input is sufficient.

The output should include: 

1. The participation percentage and total participant counts of the survey.
- Any response with a 'submitted_at' date has submitted and is said to have participated in the survey.
2. The average for each rating question
- Results from unsubmitted surveys should not be considered in the output. 

## Other information

Please include a Readme with any additional information you would like to include. You may wish to use it to explain any design decisions.

Despite this being a small command line app, please approach this as you would a production problem using whatever approach to coding and testing you feel appropriate. Successful candidates will be asked to extend their implementation in a pair programming session as a component of the interview, so consider extensibility.

## Submitting your solution

Assuming you use Git, when you’re ready to submit your solution, please use `git bundle` to package up a copy of your repository (with complete commit history) as a single file and send it to us as an email attachment. 

```
git bundle create culture-amp-coding-test.bundle master
```

We're looking forward to your innovative solutions!
